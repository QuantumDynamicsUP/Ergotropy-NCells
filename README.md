# Ergotropy-NCells
Calculation of the ergotropy in self-discharge due to environmental effects of N coupled quantum battery cells in different configurations. Coherence and entanglement evaluation. 

We analyze the impact of quantum effects on the performance of self-discharge processes in batteries. This process is analogous to the energy decay processes inherent in conventional batteries. In this study, the advantages of using coherence as a resource to optimize the ergotropy, which represents the usable energy in single-qubit systems, are analyzed. In addition, the model is extended to systems of interacting N-qubits to explore the resource of quantum entanglement and to analyze the collective decay resulting from the interaction between batteries (qubits). In this study, the influence of the geometry in which the system is configured for arrays of N = 4 and N = 5 batteries is also analyzed to determine the effect of the geometry on the decay times in the self-discharging process of the system.
